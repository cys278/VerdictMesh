# Contributing to VerdictMesh

First off, thank you for considering contributing to VerdictMesh! It’s people like you who will help build the universal reasoning layer for high-stakes AI.

### Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Code your contribution following the standards below.
3. Test your Agent, Skill, or Aggregator locally (see testing notes below).
4. Submit a Pull Request. By submitting, you agree to the licensing terms in the [Licensing of Contributions](#licensing-of-contributions) section below.
5. All PRs are personally vetted for logic, safety, and architectural fit.

### The Minimal-Dependency Rule

**VerdictMesh stays lightweight.** The core framework (`src/verdictmesh`) has exactly one dependency: **Pydantic**. Skill parsing (`skills.py`) is deliberately hand-rolled stdlib — no YAML library — to keep that count at one.

**Do NOT** add heavy ML SDKs (`langchain`, `llama-index`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `transformers`, etc.) to `pyproject.toml`.

If you're building an integration, demo, or specific LLM wrapper, place it in `cookbook/` where users opt into those dependencies themselves.

### 1. Adding a New Official Agent Preset

Official agents in VerdictMesh are built from two pieces: a **Skill** (the domain knowledge, as a markdown file) and a **preset factory function** (the wiring). You do not need to write a new `Agent` subclass — `SkilledAgent` already handles execution.

**Step 1 — Write the Skill.**
Create a new folder under `src/verdictmesh/agents/skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. Required frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`. Optional: `version`.

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: One sentence describing what this skill teaches the agent.
version: 1.0.0
---

## Your Skill Title
1. Step-by-step domain guidance goes here...
```

Rules for Skill content:
- **Provider-agnostic.** No vendor-specific prompting tricks, no assumptions about a particular model's context window.
- **Markdown only — no bundled scripts or executable code.** This is a hard rule; skills that execute code are a supply-chain risk we don't accept.
- Frontmatter is flat `key: value` pairs only — no nested lists or objects (our parser is intentionally simple, by design, to avoid a YAML dependency).

**Step 2 — Register the preset factory.**
Add a function to `src/verdictmesh/agents/presets.py` following the existing pattern:

```python
def your_agent(llm_callable: LLMCallable, extra_skills: Optional[List[Skill]] = None) -> SkilledAgent:
    base_skills = _load_skills("verdictmesh.agents.skills.<domain>", "your-skill-name")
    return SkilledAgent(
        role="Your Agent's Persona",
        goal="What this agent is trying to achieve.",
        input_description="What kind of input data this agent expects.",
        llm_callable=llm_callable,
        skills=base_skills + (extra_skills or [])
    )
```

**Step 3 — Register the package data.**
If this is a new domain folder, add it to `pyproject.toml`'s `package-data` so the SKILL.md ships inside the built wheel.

**Step 4 — Tests.**
At minimum: the preset raises without `llm_callable`, ships with the skill attached, has a non-empty `role`/`goal`, and correctly merges `extra_skills`. See `tests/test_presets.py` for the pattern.

**Step 5 — Docs.**
Add a row to the appropriate table in `README.md` under "Official Preset Agents."

### 2. Building a Fully Custom Agent (not a preset)

If your contribution needs custom execution logic beyond prompting — live API calls, custom tool-calling, a different output structure — subclass `Agent` directly instead of using a preset:

```python
from verdictmesh.base import Agent
from typing import Callable, Any


class NetworkSecurityAgent(Agent):
    """Scans network logs for unauthorized access attempts and misconfigurations."""

    def __init__(self, llm_callable: Callable[[str], Any]):
        super().__init__(
            role="Network Security Specialist",
            goal="Identify active intrusion patterns and open-port vulnerabilities.",
            input_description="A raw network log or firewall configuration file.",
            llm_callable=llm_callable
        )

    def execute(self, problem_data: str) -> Any:
        # self._build_prompt() gives you the strict isolated identity prompt.
        # You own everything else — custom tool schemas, API calls, parsing.
        prompt = self._build_prompt(problem_data)
        return self.llm_callable(prompt)
```

These are contributed as standalone examples in `cookbooks/`, not registered as official presets, unless a maintainer explicitly agrees to adopt one into the core catalog.

### 3. Adding a New Official Aggregator

Aggregators live in `src/verdictmesh/aggregators/`.

**Requirements:**
- Inherit from `verdictmesh.Aggregator`.
- Process a `Dict[str, str]` of agent reports via `self._format_reports(...)`.
- Define a Pydantic output schema in `schema.py` (see `ConflictReport` as a reference) using `model_config = ConfigDict(extra='ignore')` so hallucinated LLM keys don't crash validation.
- Handle the "insufficient input" edge case explicitly — see `ConflictChecker`'s mathematical safety gate (aborts cleanly if fewer than 2 valid reports arrive) for the expected pattern.
- Export it from `src/verdictmesh/aggregators/__init__.py`.
- Add tests covering: normal execution, malformed LLM output, and your insufficient-input edge case.
- Add a section to `README.md` under "Official Enterprise Aggregators."

### Creating Demo Examples

Demos are the best way to show VerdictMesh in action, and the place for anything that needs a heavier dependency (an LLM SDK, `pandas`, etc.).

**Structure:**
```
cookbook/XX-your-demo/
├── requirements.txt   <-- MANDATORY: demo-specific libraries
├── run_demo.py        <-- MANDATORY: entry point
└── README.md          <-- optional: explain the use case
```
❌ Never add demo-specific dependencies to the core `pyproject.toml`.

## Code Standards

### Threading Safety
⚠️ **Critical:** Agents run in parallel threads via `Engine`. Avoid global state, mutable module-level variables, or non-thread-safe resources inside `execute()`. Your code should be stateless relative to other agents.

### Type Hinting
All public methods and function signatures need type hints. Use `LLMCallable` (`Callable[[str], Any]`) for model execution parameters.

### Documentation
Every class needs a docstring. Be descriptive — docstrings are read by contributors, not by the LLM (unlike the Skill markdown content, which the model does read).

### Error Handling
Never let a failed LLM call crash the Engine. Rely on `format_output()`'s existing safety nets rather than adding new ad hoc exception handling.
