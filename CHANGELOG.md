## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-07
 
### Added
 
#### Insider Threat Analyst Preset
Added `insider_threat_analyst`, a new official Security preset detecting anomalous behavior from already-authenticated users: unusual access timing, abnormal data exports, and privileged-action deviations. Explicitly scoped to post-login behavior only; external intrusion and IoC analysis stay with `security_threat_hunter`. Contributed by [@Leenaa-patil](https://github.com/Leenaa-patil).
 
#### Breach Notification Analyst Preset
Added `breach_notification_analyst`, the regulatory-risk lens in the Security preset series. Takes the same incident/log evidence as the other security presets and determines whether an incident involves personal data and triggers legal breach-notification obligations, evaluating GDPR Art. 33 (72-hour supervisory-authority notification) and Art. 34 (high-risk individual notification) duties and timelines. Scoped to notification obligations only; technical severity assessment stays with `security_threat_hunter`. Contributed by [@shariqueahmad108-ship-it](https://github.com/shariqueahmad108-ship-it).
 
#### Identity & Access Auditor Preset
Added `identity_access_auditor`, a new official Security preset analyzing authentication and authorization events: failed-login clustering (brute-force vs. credential stuffing vs. user error), privilege-escalation chains, and MFA-bypass indicators, to determine how access was obtained. Scoped strictly to the access-grant and authentication layer; complements `security_threat_hunter` (external intrusion) and `insider_threat_analyst` (post-login behavior) without overlapping either.
 
#### WeightedSynthesizer Aggregator
Added `WeightedSynthesizer`, a `Synthesizer` variant for proportional emphasis: perspectives are weighted by agent role so higher-weighted reports drive the final narrative's framing and conclusions, while lower-weighted ones are folded in as supporting context. This is emphasis in the blend, not conflict resolution (that stays with `ConflictChecker`), the weighting is applied even when all experts agree. Roles missing from the configured weights fall back to `default_weight` (1.0) rather than being silently dropped, weights are normalized to sum to 1.0, and `weights_applied`/`dominant_perspective` are computed deterministically by the aggregator itself (not returned by the LLM) and recorded on the result as an audit trail of how the blend was shaped. Contributed by [@OrienSpec](https://github.com/OrienSpec).
 
#### New Cookbook Recipe: Weighted Due-Diligence
Added `cookbook/07-weighted-due-diligence/`, demonstrating `WeightedSynthesizer` in a due-diligence council where one perspective (e.g. the CTO's technical risk assessment) is deliberately weighted to dominate the final narrative while other experts are still represented.
 
#### New Cookbook Recipe: AI Feature Compliance Gate
Added `cookbook/06-ai-feature-compliance-gate-anthropic/`, wired to the Anthropic Claude API via the official `anthropic` SDK. The four official compliance presets (`data_sovereignty_auditor`, `ai_risk_assessor`, `phi_sanitizer`, `licensing_reviewer`) review the same feature dossier in parallel isolation, with a `Synthesizer` merging them into a go/no-go memo. Self-contained with its own `requirements.txt`; no change to core `pyproject.toml`. Contributed by [@OrienSpec](https://github.com/OrienSpec).
 
#### Technical White Paper
Added `docs/white-paper.md`, a full engineering deep-dive covering the `Engine` orchestration model (thread isolation, fault handling, timeout semantics), the `Agent`/`Aggregator` base contracts, the Skills frontmatter parser, and the `ConflictChecker`/`WeightedSynthesizer` implementations, grounded in the architecture validated by "Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems" (arXiv:2512.08296).
 
### Fixed
 
#### `security_threat_hunter` Missing From Package Exports
`security_threat_hunter` was merged and fully functional in `presets.py` back in v0.6.0, but was never added to `agents/__init__.py`'s imports and `__all__`. `from verdictmesh.agents.presets import security_threat_hunter` worked; `from verdictmesh.agents import security_threat_hunter` silently failed. Fixed alongside the rest of the Security preset export cleanup for this release.
 
#### README Documentation Gaps
Added the missing "Security" preset table to the README (previously undocumented despite `security_threat_hunter`, `insider_threat_analyst`, and `breach_notification_analyst` already being merged), and corrected the stale "9 available specialists" count to 13.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

#### Security Threat Hunter Preset
Added `security_threat_hunter`, a new official preset for identifying intrusion patterns and anomalous network behavior. Contributed by [@Leenaa-patil](https://github.com/Leenaa-patil) — our first community-contributed preset! 🎉

#### Engine Resilience Controls
Introduced `agent_timeout` and `max_workers` parameters on `Engine`. `agent_timeout` caps how long the parallel batch waits for straggling agents before proceeding without them — the executor now shuts down without blocking on stragglers in this case, so slow or hung agents no longer silently stall the entire workflow. `max_workers` caps concurrent agent threads, useful for respecting provider rate limits when running larger agent councils.

#### Completeness Gate for High-Stakes Workflows
Added `require_all_agents` to `Engine`. When enabled, any single agent failure halts the workflow *before* the aggregator is ever invoked, raising `IncompleteAgentBatchError` rather than silently synthesizing a verdict from partial data. This is aimed at audit-critical pipelines — e.g. a due-diligence council where a missing compliance check shouldn't be quietly absorbed into a "looks fine" consensus. Defaults to `False`, preserving the existing partial-synthesis behavior.

#### Refined Exception Taxonomy
Introduced `NoValidReportsError` (raised when every parallel agent fails) and `IncompleteAgentBatchError` (raised when `require_all_agents=True` and some, but not all, agents fail — includes `.failed_roles` and `.succeeded_roles` for precise programmatic handling).

#### Pydantic Schema Enforcement (`output_format`)
`SkilledAgent` and all official presets now natively accept a Pydantic `BaseModel` via the `output_format` argument. When provided, the framework automatically injects the strict JSON schema requirements into the LLM prompt, enforcing structured, machine-readable output without requiring custom subclassing.

#### Dynamic Preset Overrides
Users can now override the default `input_description` parameter across all preset factory functions on the fly, allowing for highly specific context instructions without altering the underlying agent configuration.

### Changed

#### Stricter Agent Role Validation
`Engine` now validates that all agent roles are unique at construction time, raising `ValueError` immediately. Previously, duplicate roles would silently overwrite each other's reports mid-aggregation with no indication anything was lost.

#### Deterministic Audit Trails
`Report.traces` now preserves the exact order agents were passed into `Engine`, rather than the order their LLM calls happened to complete in. Audit trails are now reproducible run-to-run regardless of network timing.

#### ⚠️ BREAKING: `AggregatorError` Scope Narrowed
`AggregatorError` is now raised only when the aggregator itself fails during synthesis. The "all agents failed" case — previously also using `AggregatorError` — now raises the more specific `NoValidReportsError`. Code catching `AggregatorError` to handle both cases should be updated to catch `NoValidReportsError` separately. Consistent with our pre-1.0 policy of allowing minor breaking changes where they meaningfully improve error precision.

### Fixed

#### `agent_timeout` Silently Ignored Its Own Deadline
The initial implementation correctly labeled timed-out agents in the audit trace, but `ThreadPoolExecutor`'s context-manager exit blocked on ALL submitted work regardless of the configured timeout — meaning `Engine.run()` could still hang for the full duration of the slowest agent even after logically deciding to move on without it. The executor is now managed explicitly with a non-blocking shutdown path specifically for the timeout case, so `run()` reliably returns control at the configured deadline.

#### Total Failure Misreported Under `require_all_agents`
Fixed an ordering bug where, with `require_all_agents=True`, a total agent failure (zero successes across the board) was incorrectly surfaced as `IncompleteAgentBatchError` instead of the more accurate `NoValidReportsError`. Total-failure detection is now checked unconditionally, ahead of the completeness gate.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

#### Zero-Dependency Skills Engine
Introduced the `Skill` and `SkilledAgent` classes to parse domain expertise and operational procedure directly from structured Markdown (`SKILL.md`) files. Features a native frontmatter parser for metadata (`name`, `description`, `version`) that operates entirely on the Python standard library, requiring no external YAML dependencies.

#### Regulatory & Compliance Auditors
Shipped a catalog of out-of-the-box legal presets (`data_sovereignty_auditor`, `ai_risk_assessor`, `phi_sanitizer`, `licensing_reviewer`) powered by the new Skills Engine. These agents are strictly configured to flag GDPR cross-border violations, EU AI Act risk tiers, PHI mishandling, and copyleft licensing contamination.

#### Executive Due-Diligence Board (C-Suite)
Introduced adversarial strategy presets (`cfo_agent`, `cto_agent`, `cro_agent`, `cpo_agent`, `cmo_agent`) designed for parallel M&A and business case evaluation. Each preset isolates the LLM's attention budget to a single executive domain (e.g., tech debt vs. runway analysis) to prevent cognitive bias and semantic distraction.

### Changed

#### Beta Promotion & Package Maturity
Upgraded the project maturity Trove Classifier to `Development Status :: 4 - Beta` in `pyproject.toml` to accurately reflect the framework's stability and enterprise-readiness while reserving the right for minor API iterations prior to v1.0.0.

### Fixed

#### Package Data Resolution & Integrity
Configured `setuptools` package-data discovery in `pyproject.toml` (`**/*.md`) to guarantee all bundled `SKILL.md` knowledge packs are successfully included in the built wheel. Integrated `importlib.resources` within the preset factories to flawlessly locate and load these files regardless of the host environment's execution path.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-07

### Added

#### Aggregator Resilience Gates
Implemented a `min_required_reports` threshold in the `Aggregator` base logic. This prevents vacuous consensus generation when upstream agent failures result in insufficient evidence for reliable aggregation.

#### Anti-Hallucination Guardrails
Introduced automatic system-level prompt injection in the `Synthesizer`. When only a partial panel of specialist agents is available, the framework explicitly instructs the reasoning model to synthesize conclusions exclusively from the available reports, reducing the risk of hallucinated expert opinions.

#### Dynamic Bilateral Binding
Updated the `ConflictChecker` with strict role binding for the `citations` and `involved_agents` schemas. The reasoning model can now reference only agents that actually produced reports, preventing fabricated agent names during bilateral conflict analysis.

---

### Fixed

#### Engine Aggregator Hand-off
Refactored the `Engine` execution pipeline so that failed agent outputs remain available in the audit trace for debugging while being excluded from the data passed to aggregators. This prevents exception messages and stack traces from contaminating the synthesis context provided to LLMs.

#### Multi-threaded Thread Isolation
Resolved `StopIteration` exceptions and race conditions in the `ConflictChecker` pairwise threading implementation. Improved failure diagnostics by enabling `exc_info=True`, ensuring complete stack traces are captured for individual thread failures without disrupting the thread pool.

#### Framework Export Integrity
Fixed missing package dunder definitions (including `__all__` and `__init__`) in `src/verdictmesh/__init__.py` and `base.py`. Also corrected export inconsistencies in `aggregators/__init__.py` to ensure proper package imports.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Engine Fault Tolerance**: The core `Engine` now features resilient error trapping. If an individual agent crashes (e.g., API timeout or execution failure), the engine safely catches the exception, logs it, updates the trace status to `"error"`, and allows the workflow to proceed to the Aggregator without crashing the main thread.
- **New Cookbook Recipe**: Added the `Supply Chain Replanning` demo. This enterprise-grade recipe showcases autonomous, tool-calling agents and the official `Synthesizer` aggregator, demonstrating how to isolate agents into their own dedicated `agents/` microservice directory.
- **Advanced Testing Suite**: Expanded `pytest` coverage to explicitly validate Engine resilience, Pydantic schema serialization, single-turn/two-turn API loops, and pure prompt generation.

### Changed
- **"Pure Engine" Architectural Pivot** *(Breaking Change)*: VerdictMesh has officially transitioned into a lightweight, pure orchestration layer. The framework no longer dictates *how* LLMs call tools, giving developers 100% flexibility over their API execution loops.
- **Native Provider Support**: Developers can now use official, native tool-calling arrays (like OpenAI's `tools=[...]`) directly within an agent's `execute()` method, eliminating framework-induced JSON parsing hallucinations and dramatically improving execution speed.
- **Pydantic Output Parsing & Error Handling**: Upgraded the core execution pipeline to natively utilize Pydantic for output parsing and error handling. `format_output` now automatically serializes Pydantic models, and validation errors are safely trapped and parsed.
- **Streamlined `_build_prompt`**: The base identity helper now exclusively generates the strict "Forced Perspective" constraint prompt without attempting to inject dynamic tool schemas.

### Removed
- **`@tool` Decorator Magic** *(Breaking Change)*: Stripped the `@tool` decorator, `_discover_tools()`, and the dynamic `TYPE_MAP` from the base `Agent` class. VerdictMesh prioritizes enterprise stability and zero-tech-debt over fragile "magic" routing wrappers.

### Fixed
- **Synthesizer "Template Overfitting" Bug**: Fixed a prompt hallucination in the official `Synthesizer` aggregator where the LLM would literally output `"Agent Role"` as a dictionary key. The prompt now enforces strict, dynamic mapping of actual agent names for the `citations` output.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- **Official Aggregators**: Introduced the first native, domain-agnostic aggregators to the VerdictMesh core:
    - `Synthesizer`: Merges isolated agent reports into a single cohesive narrative.
    - `ConflictChecker`: Audits agent reports for logical inconsistencies using configurable `pairwise_audit` logic (supporting both multi-threaded isolation and dynamic prompt-matrices).
- **Core JSON Utilities**: Added `utils.py` featuring a robust `parse_and_validate_json` helper to ensure LLM outputs strictly adhere to framework schemas, providing automated fault tolerance.
- **Aggregator Schemas**: Added `SynthesisResult` and `ConflictReport` dataclasses to `schema.py` to support the new official aggregators.
- **Advanced Execution Tracing**: Introduced a `show_log` boolean across the `Engine` and official aggregators. When enabled, it provides a clean, Terminal UI (TUI) tree structure to track asynchronous thread dispatching and API lifecycles.
- **New Cookbook Recipe**: Added `Confict Analysis` demo using our new `ConflictChecker` aggregator. A high-stakes enterprise recipe demonstrating Executive Conflict Analysis for M&A Due Diligence.


### Changed
- **Directory Restructure**: Renamed the `demo_examples` directory to `cookbook` to align with standard open-source framework conventions.
- **Agent Initialization**: Relaxed constraints on the `Agent` base class by making the `input_description` parameter optional.
- **Medical Diagnostics Recipe**: Upgraded the existing medical diagnostics run script to natively utilize the new official `Synthesizer` aggregator.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Dependency Injection (BYO-LLM)**: Added `llm_callable` initialization parameters to both `Agent` and `Aggregator` base classes. This completely decouples the framework from any specific LLM provider or SDK.

- **Custom Type Alias**: Introduced `LLMCallable = Callable[[str], Any]` to standardize model execution signatures across the framework.

- **Sensible Defaults & Dynamic Tools**: Added the `_build_prompt()` helper method to the `Agent` base class.
    - Automatically enforces "Double-Blind" isolation instructions.
    - Dynamically discovers and injects `@tool` JSON schemas directly into the system prompt.

- **Engine Safety Net**: Added `format_output` to the `Agent` base class to safely stringify unexpected agent return types before Phase 1 engine mapping, preventing dictionary mapping crashes.

### Changed

- **Structured Outputs Supported**: Changed the return type of `Aggregator.execute()` and `Report.consensus` from `str` to `Any`.
    - Aggregators can now natively return parsed JSON dictionaries or Pydantic models directly to the user's application.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Agent Metadata**: Added a required `input_description` parameter to the `Agent` base class. This ensures all agents published to the Hub clearly define their expected data format (e.g., "JSON string of patient vitals" vs. "Raw text SEC filing").

### Changed
- **License Update**: Transitioned from MIT to **Business Source License (BSL) 1.1** to protect enterprise interests.
- **Aggregator Refactor**: Renamed `Aggregator.synthesize()` to `Aggregator.execute()`. This reflects that aggregators can perform any logical operation, not just synthesis.
- **Scientific Alignment**: Rewrote `README.md` to include performance benchmarks (+80.8% accuracy) based on the 2026 Google/MIT Scaling Paper.

### Removed
- **Unbiased Synthesis**: Removed the `problem_data` argument from the `Aggregator.execute()` method. 
    - *Rationale*: To ensure zero-bias synthesis, the Aggregator is now "blind" to the initial input, forcing it to judge the final verdict solely based on the conflicting or supporting evidence provided by the specialized agents.
