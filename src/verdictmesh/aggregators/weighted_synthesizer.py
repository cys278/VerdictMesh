class WeightedSynthesizer(Aggregator):
    """
    An official VerdictMesh aggregator that blends isolated expert reports into a
    single narrative with *proportional emphasis* — higher-weighted perspectives
    drive the framing and conclusions, lower-weighted ones are folded in as
    supporting context.

    This is distinct from conflict resolution (``ConflictChecker``). Weighting
    here is about baseline prominence in the blend, not about resolving
    disagreement — even when all experts fully agree, a heavier weight makes that
    expert the throughline of the narrative.

    Because "weighting qualitative prose" has no literal numeric average, the
    weights shape the *prompt*: each report is annotated with its share and the
    LLM is instructed to structure the narrative accordingly. The audit fields
    on the result (``weights_applied``, ``dominant_perspective``) are computed
    deterministically here, so they always reflect the real configuration rather
    than anything the LLM might hallucinate.

    Args:
        llm_callable: Model-agnostic execution function (prompt: str) -> str.
        weights: Relative emphasis keyed by agent role. Roles present in the
            reports but missing from this dict fall back to ``default_weight``
            (they are never silently dropped). Weights are normalized to sum to
            1.0 for the blend and for ``weights_applied``.
        custom_goal: Optional override for the synthesizer's goal statement.
        default_weight: Weight assigned to any responding role absent from
            ``weights`` (default 1.0 — equal footing).
        show_log: If True, prints progress to stdout.

        INSTRUCTIONS:
        INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Synthesize the expert reports below into a single, comprehensive response.
        2. WEIGHTED EMPHASIS BANDS: Each report is annotated with an emphasis weight (%).
           Apply these bands literally — treat them as hard requirements, not stylistic
           suggestions:
             - ANCHOR (weight >= 40%): This is the dominant perspective, "{dominant}".
               It MUST open the narrative and drive the framing and conclusions. Give it
               3+ dedicated narrative sentences and 2-3 dedicated key_takeaways.
             - MAJOR (weight 20-39%): Give it at least 2 dedicated narrative sentences and
               exactly 1-2 dedicated key_takeaways. It must read as a distinct, substantive
               perspective — not a footnote to the anchor.
             - SUPPORTING (weight 8-19%): Give it at least 1 dedicated narrative sentence
               and exactly 1 dedicated key_takeaway.
             - MINOR (weight < 8%): May share a single narrative sentence with another
               minor perspective. A dedicated key_takeaway is optional, but the perspective
               MUST still be named at least once in the narrative — never omitted entirely.
           Every responding agent falls into exactly one band based on its annotated weight.
           Do not collapse MAJOR or SUPPORTING perspectives down to MINOR treatment just
           because they are not the anchor.
        3. STRICT ORDERING: The key_takeaways list MUST be sorted by descending emphasis
           weight of its source perspective — highest-weighted perspective's takeaway(s)
           first, lowest-weighted last. Before finalizing your answer, verify this ordering
           holds for every consecutive pair in the list.
        4. This is emphasis, not conflict resolution: apply the weighting even if all experts agree.
        5. ANTI-HALLUCINATION GUARDRAIL: Synthesize strictly and ONLY from the reports provided.
           Do NOT invent perspectives for missing specialists.

        REPORTS:
        {compiled_reports}

        Return ONLY valid JSON with the exact following structure:
        {{
            "narrative": "A cohesive narrative whose framing and conclusions are driven by the higher-weighted perspectives.",
            "key_takeaways": ["List of actionable insights, ordered so the dominant perspective's points lead."],
            "confidence": 0.0, // Float [0.0 - 1.0] representing your subjective confidence.
            "citations": {{
                "<Insert Actual Agent Role>": "A brief snippet or quote from this agent's report that supports your findings."
            }}
        }}

        CRITICAL DICTIONARY RULES FOR 'citations':
        - The KEYS of the citations dictionary MUST be selected strictly from this list of responding agents: [{valid_roles}].
        - Do NOT literally write "Agent Role" or "<Insert Actual Agent Role>".
        - Do NOT fabricate citation keys for agents that did not provide a report.

        CRITICAL FORMATTING: Do not include any conversational text, markdown formatting, or explanations outside the JSON.
